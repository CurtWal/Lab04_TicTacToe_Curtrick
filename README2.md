How Do You Use It?
When you run the "dotnet run" command in the console, you'll see the welcome game line. You'll be prompted to enter the name of the first player, who will be X, then the second player, who will be O. The game follows as traditional Tic-Tac-Toe, whoever gets three in a row first is the winner. To claim a space, the player will be notified that it's their turn, then they'll be prompted to select a location on the board. The board is numbered 1-9 in a grid and the user can type in the number corresponding with the spot they'd like to claim. If all spaces are filled without a win, the game is declared a draw. The winner will be congratulated at the end of the game. Lastly after game ends a prompt will popup asking if the user wants to play again. If the user inputs Y the game will replay. If N the game will end saying thanks for playing.
